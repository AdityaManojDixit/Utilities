# Utilities
Java program that accepts path as input from the user & replaces all backslashes "\" with fwd. slash "/".<br>
Advantages: Useful when using Git for windows as it uses "/" to seperate directories/folders in path address.<br>

Example: Bash Terminal:

          intel@DESKTOP-XXXXX ~ 
          $ java fs 
          Enter the path: 
          F:\Folders\Programming\Algos\Searching //Input Path 
          F:/Folders/Programming/Algos/Searching  //Output Path
